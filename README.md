# Beautiful-Binary-String-algo
This code addresses the Alternating Characters problem through the removal of consecutive duplicate characters by counting. It iterates over the string in sequence, comparing each character with its immediate successor to identify consecutive duplicates. The algorithm updates a deletion counter whenever two consecutive characters are the same, thus resulting in a final string with only alternating characters.
